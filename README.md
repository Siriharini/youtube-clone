##Project Overview
Simple YouTube Clone (Front-End)
Purpose: To demonstrate the ability to replicate a complex web interface using core front-end technologies (HTML for structure, CSS for styling). This project focuses on the visual layout and does not include dynamic functionality (e.g., video playback, search, user accounts) that would require JavaScript and a backend.

Key Features Mimicked:

Header (Logo, Search Bar, User/Action Icons)
Sidebar/Navigation (Home, Explore, Subscriptions, Library, etc.)
Main Content Area (Video Thumbnails, Titles, Channel Names, Views, Upload Time)
Responsive Design (optional, but highly recommended for a realistic clone)

2. File Structure
A typical project structure for this kind of clone would look like this:
youtube-clone/
├── index.html          (Main page structure)
├── css/
│   └── style.css       (All custom CSS rules)
├── images/             (Optional: for placeholder thumbnails, logos, icons)
│   ├── logo.png
│   └── thumbnail1.jpg
│   └── user-avatar.png
└── README.md           (This conceptual file, if it were real)

Each item (e.g., "Home", "Explore", "Subscriptions") would be an <a> tag, possibly with an icon (<i> or <img>).
Sections for "Library", "History", "Watch Later", etc.
"Subscriptions" section with channel avatars.
